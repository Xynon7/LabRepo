The code that was generated included constructors, setters and getters. It also generated many useful comments, along with better toString methods.
The One to Many relations also created List<> rather than arrays, which could be more useful or worse depending on the circumstances.
This would be very useful when creating a large Java program. Not only does Umple make the design stage of the coding much easier,
it also removes many tedious tasks from the beginning of the project.
Umple would probably be less useful for small or insignificant classes, because there would be a lot of extra code and unnecessary comments.
However, large projects would benefit greatly from the use of Umple, because large numbers of classes and class relations could be easily created.
